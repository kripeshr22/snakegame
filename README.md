# snakegame
A normal snake Game where you can move the snake with your arrow keys. The snake grows as you eat more food and it changes color everytime you eat food. There is also a score counter on the screen that keeps track of your score (i.e the no of food your snake has consumed). Play until you hit the edges or bump into yourself!

This program uses the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">Turtle Library</a>.
